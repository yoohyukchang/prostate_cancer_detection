Due to model size, we could not upload trained models to the repo. Therefore, we uploaded it to OneDrive and required a JHU email to access it. We did this to protect the file as
best as possible while allowing faculty and TAs access. They can edit this folder, so please reach out to rmcgove3@jhu.edu if you cannot see either trained model.
